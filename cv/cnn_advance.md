# CNN advance

## ResNet

Skip connection

Improve:

- DenseNet: Skip connection form all previous ConvBlock
- ResNeSt: Combined split attention and skip connection to balance accuracy and efficiency.

## InceptionNet

Multi-scale filters

## SENet

Introduced a channel-wise attention mechanism to enhance feature recalibration.

improve: ECA-Net

## Dynamic CNN

- CondConv: Adjust **filter weights** dynamically depending on the input.
- SkipNet: Skip certain layers dynamically depending on the input.

## EfficientNet

Introduced a compound scaling method to scale depth, width, and resolution efficiently.

(PS. NAS searched architecture.)
