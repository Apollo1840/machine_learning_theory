Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed primarily for processing structured grid data like images. 

CNN works primarily by its convolution operation in its convolution layer.


In a convolutional layer, filters **slide** over the image spatially performing a **convolution operation**(i.e. elementwise multiplication and sum) to produce a **feature map** that highlights the presence of specific morphological features.


After several convolutional layers, the deep feature maps are flattened to be further processed in the neural work to perform tasks like classification.
