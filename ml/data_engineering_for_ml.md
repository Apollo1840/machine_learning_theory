# Data Engineering for ML (DEML)

## Selection bias
Selection bias occurs when the data collected for a dataset is not representative of the population it's intended to reflect. 
This bias can happen due to **non-random** sampling (eg. systematic exclusion of certain groups).
It can significantly harm the **generalizability** of machine learning models.

How to avoid:
- use case study
- ensure random selection instead of ranked selection based on availability.
- Differentiating sources of data. Good stratify.

## Exclude outlier
 

## Normalization
- Standardization
- min-max normalization
