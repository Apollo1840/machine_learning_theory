- Partition-based
  - K-means: iterative updated the center of k-clusters with the mean of the cluster members.
  - Hierarchy  
- Density-based
  - DBSCAN: by identifying core data points, clusters are found by core points infection, and regions of lower density will separate them.
- Model-based
  - GMM: Assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions and uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters.
- Graph-based
  - Spectral clustering: data is represented as nodes in a graph, the method splits the graph into sub-graphs using the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix.
