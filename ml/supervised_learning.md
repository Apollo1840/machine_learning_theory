# Supervised learning methods

## Regression

### Linear regression

Polynomial regression

Advance:
- Linear regression with AIC step
- Ridge regression; Lasson regression
- Robust regression

## Classification

### Logistic regression

### Decision tree (forest)

### SVM

SVM with kernel

### kNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works based on the idea that similar data points are close to each other in the feature space.

- classification: the label of an instance is the majority of labels of its k neighbors.
- regression: the value of an input is the average value of its k neighbors.

disadvantage: too-strong assumption; memory and computationally intensive.



### NN (MLPClassifier: Multi-layer Perceptron)

### AdaBoosting
