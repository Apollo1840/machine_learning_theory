## Categories
Basically, there are three categories of machine learning.
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Semi-supervised learning

Under supervise learning, there are:
- regression
- classification ...

Under Unsuperives learning, there are 
- clustering ...

## Data engineering and feature selection
Prerequisites of ML, introduced in `data_engineering_for_ml.md` 
and `feature selection.md`. 

## Models
models for supervised learning(`supervised_learning.md`) and unsupervised learning(`unsupervised_learning.md`).

## Metrics
To evaluate the models: `metrics.md`.
