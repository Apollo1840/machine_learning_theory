# Retrieval
Retrieval task is  finding relevant information from a large collection of data.

## Document Retrieval (Search Engines)

Given a search query like "best deep learning books", the system retrieves relevant books or articles from a large database (e.g., Google Search, Wikipedia search).

## Passage Retrieval (Open-Domain QA)

In open-domain question answering (e.g., GPT-powered chatbots), the model retrieves relevant passages before answering the question.
Example: "Who invented transformers in deep learning?" â†’ Retrieve a passage discussing Vaswani et al. (2017).

## Image Retrieval

Given an image, retrieve similar images from a large dataset (e.g., Google Reverse Image Search).

## Dense Retrieval (Embedding-based)

Uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents instead of just keyword matching.
Example: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) retrieves similar embeddings efficiently.
