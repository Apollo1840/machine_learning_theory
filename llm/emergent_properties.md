## Emergent process (Grokking)
Model reaches its bottleneck on training set performance but increased its generalizaiton ablity "suddenly".

Three mechanistic Understanding:

- Continuing regulization (Explicit and Implicit) leads to benign overfitting.
- Double Descent (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02292).
- Competing circuits


## Emergent properties
Large model gains significant abilities which small models can not have. Or in a more dynamic way, some complex model functionality get suddenly improved from unable to capable respect to increasing of model capacity.

Discussion about that some people believe its because we used discrete (threshold) metrics. If we use more smooth metrics, then the increase of the performance on those high-level abitlites is smooth.
