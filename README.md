# Machine Learning Meta Book


This is not a stand-alone book but rather a collection of extensive references, specifically designed for senior machine learning researchers.
It does not include many implementation details and instead focuses more on mathematical foundations.

This is a highly advanced book that strives to be as deep as possible, but it does so at the expense of details, implementation methods, and breadth of subtopics within subfields.

## Application
Nowadays, the application of AI nearly covers everything, but we still can trying to list
all its ablities.

### Modality
One way is categorized them by modalities of input/output:
- text to text
    - natural chat
    - text-based/code-based tasks (almost cover everything, but the intelligence level is limited)
    - text to diagram: flow chart, mind map
- image to image: coloring, segementation
- text to image
- image to text
  - image to structured data

### Major/Discipline
Another way is categorized them by human-defined field:
