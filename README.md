# Machine Learning Meta Book


This is not a stand-alone book but rather a collection of extensive references, specifically designed for senior machine learning researchers.
It does not include many implementation details and instead focuses more on mathematical foundations.

This is a highly advanced book that strives to be as deep as possible, but it does so at the expense of details, implementation methods, and breadth of subtopics within subfields.
