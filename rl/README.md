Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where 

    an agent learns to make decisions to achieve a specific goal. 

The agent learns through receiving **feedback** from its actions within an environment in the form of rewards (or penalties).

## Methods

### Q-learning
It is a model-free RL algorithm, which directly estimates Q(s, a) to generate optimal current actions.
