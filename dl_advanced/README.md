# Advanced Deep Learning

## Robust AI
see `robust.md`.

## Efficient AI
There two aspects of this topic:
- make model smaller (with **reasonable** cost of performance)
- make big model more efficient (with **minimum** cost of performance)

### lower resource design
see `model_efficiency.md`, `model_distillation.md`.

### minimum-cost design (Edge AI)
see `model_distillation.md`.

Also includes smart split of task between local model and remote big model service.
