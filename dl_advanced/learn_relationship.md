# Relationship learning

`(a, R, b)`

## Simple modeling

### Function relations
Assumption: 

$\forall a \; \exists! \, b ; (a, R, b)$

we can train a $f$ with (a, R, b) pairs:
$b = f(a, R) = f(g_o(a), g_r(R))$
Good thing about this modeling is we got object embedding $g_o$ and relation embedding $g_r$.
