# Model efficiency

## Model structual optimization
NAS with combined target.
- DARTS, based on differential.
- NASNet, based on RL.
- EfficientNet, combined with joint strategy.

## Model compression
- Prune & L1 regularization
- Low-Rank decomposition
- Parameter sharing & weights clustering

## Calculation optimization
- Quantization & Mixed Precision


## Focus on Transformer
