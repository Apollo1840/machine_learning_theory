# Model Interpretability

## Activation Maximization
This technique helps interpret what specific neurons in the network respond to by generating an input that produces the highest activation for a chosen neuron.

## Grad-CAM

## Saliency Map

## Deconv visualization
in this method, we keep only the selected neuron active and feed it back to construct the input component which contributed most to the activation of the selected neuron.
